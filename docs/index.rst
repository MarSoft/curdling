Welcome to Curdling
===================

Curdling is a command line tool for managing Python packages. It was
designed to find, build and cache all the dependencies your app needs
to start up and run smoothly. Its robust concurrency model allows
curdling to find, download and build software faster than any other
package installer we currently have

Welcome to Curdling's documentation. The content is divided into two
main parts. The :ref:`usage` teaches you how to interact with
